#TextMe, Maybe?
"TextMe, Maybe?" is an app that enables people to schedule text messages in advance and have it delivered at a predetermined date and time. There are multiple use cases for this app from the ability to schedule a text greeting in advance for a loved one to setting up reminders for group gatherings to reminding an elderly family member to take their prescription medications regularly.

Our goal was to develop a functional app that would be utilized across populations. If you've a use case that we have not yet identified, we'd love to hear about it!
